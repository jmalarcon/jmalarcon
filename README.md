### Howdy! 👋

⚡ I'm Jose Alarcón, from rainy Galicia, in the northwest of Spain (Europe). I'm an engineer, entrepeneur, writer and speaker.

💻 My code is mainly focused in 🌐 Web develoment: Front-End with JavaScript, and backend with C# and the .NET Framework, although I do a lot of this and that with other langs, frameworks and tools. 

💬 Ask me about anything related to online training in Spain, which is what I do for a living.
